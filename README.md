# Stevens-Link-Project-Management-

During my Project Management Class I learned following things:

Create a detailed project strategy in order to provide business value to the project's stakeholders.
Create a project charter.
Create a work breakdown system.
Make a project timeline.
Learn the ideas of Earned Value.
Learn the fundamental concepts and principles of managing projects using PMBOKÂ® standards.

This is the Project that we as a team developed during the class where we Developed, implemented, and controled a basic project plan capable of supporting business objectives tied to project success measures for a single project.
