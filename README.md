# Stevens-Link-Project-Management-

During my Project Management Class I learned following things:

Create a detailed project strategy in order to provide business value to the project's stakeholders.
Create a project charter.
Create a work breakdown system.
Make a project timeline.
Learn the ideas of Earned Value.
Learn the fundamental concepts and principles of managing projects using PMBOKÂ® standards.

This is the Project that we as a team developed during the class where we Developed, implemented, and controled a basic project plan capable of supporting business objectives tied to project success measures for a single project.

We saw a problem of cultural differences for international students and domestic students and came up with an application that makes interaction between them and makes them used to each other's cultures as well as values. This would be a platform where international students could interact and make new friends within campus and and easily adjust to American culture and ease up their cultural difficulties. Domestic students on the other hand could benefit from international students as they learn new things about their culture and work style.
